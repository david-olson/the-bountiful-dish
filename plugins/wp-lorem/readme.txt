== Plugin Information ==

The plugin was created in order to ease the work of the developers and the content checkers on the website.
Using the plugin allows you to add dummy content with pictures to all the posttypes on your website.

The system scans the various posttypes and with one button and minimal settings options, (how many posts you wish to create/ with or without photos etc.) allows you to create all the posts you want.
In addition, there's an option to delete all posts with that the plugin has created, which makes the delete process much faster.

In the near future, I plan on making the system even more intelligent and with additional features;
such as differentiating between the type of content/ photos and it's source.
For example, if a user chooses a particular type of content - like food, all the content and the pictures he would be subjected to would consist of the type he chose.
